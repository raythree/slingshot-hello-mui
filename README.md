# slingshot-hello-mui
For instructions, see [slingshot-hello](https://github.com/raythree/slingshot-hello). This is the same except that rather than including bootstrap, this starter is based on [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/). It is also setup with [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/7.0.1/).
